# aviator

Adds a craftabel block to the game.
After placing you will be granted fly priv in an
area of 20 nodes radius from placed block.
fly priv will be taken after 10 minutes.

The block can be digged and remaining time is saved
Also the block will be saved to inventory if you
go too far from it, if you leave the game or the
server shuts down.

Added a chatcommand "/7" to call back your aviator
to your inventory. This allows climbing and other
more convinient use of it.
